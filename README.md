# 🚀 PocketMine-MP Egg: The Definitive Edition

This is a completely revised version of the PocketMine-MP egg, originally based on the work from the [Pterodactyl Community Eggs repository](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/game_eggs/minecraft/bedrock/pocketmine_mp). It has been fixed to provide a smooth, error-free experience right from the start!

### ✨ Key Improvements:

*   ✅ **Fully Automated Installation:** The script now intelligently uses the official PocketMine-MP API. It automatically downloads the correct `.phar` file AND the required PHP binaries for the version you select. No more manual downloads!

*   🛠️ **Warning-Free Startup:** Annoying `opcache.so` warnings are a thing of the past! The installer automatically detects and writes the correct path to your server's `php.ini` file, ensuring PHP can find its extensions and your server runs at peak performance.

*   👍 **Broad Compatibility:** Full support for both modern PocketMine-MP 5 (`PM5`) and legacy PocketMine-MP 4 (`PM4`). Select the version you want, and the egg handles the rest.
